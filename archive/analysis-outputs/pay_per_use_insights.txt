## Pay-Per-Use Segment Analysis (From CheckinReports)

**Segment Discovery: The "Fence-Sitters"**

We discovered a MASSIVE segment hidden in plain sight: **1,849 unique pay-per-use players** generating **6,470 check-ins** (42% of all facility usage!).

These aren't beginners trying pickleball once. They're **regular customers** choosing to pay drop-in fees instead of joining as members.

### Real Customer Example: Mark Tomlinson (#7336003)

- **Monthly spend:** $1081 (paying drop-in fees)
- **Activity:** Drop-In Open Play | Weekday Evening
- **Skill level:** None (experienced player!)
- **Visits:** 8 times over 4 months

**The Math That Doesn't Math:**
Mark Tomlinson pays $1081/month in drop-in fees when an Individual Membership costs $120/month.

**Why aren't they converting?**
1. **Commitment anxiety** - Not sure if they'll use it enough
2. **Flexibility preference** - Sporadic play schedule
3. **Price blindness** - Haven't done the math

### Segment Behavioral Profile

**Top Activities:**
- Drop-In Open Play | Weekday Evening (351 check-ins)
- Advanced Beginner | Drills and Skills (300 check-ins)
- Open Play | Weekday Midday (284 check-ins)

**Time Preferences:**
- Unknown: 5025 check-ins
- Evening: 769 check-ins
- Midday: 596 check-ins
- Morning: 80 check-ins

**Price Points:**
- Average drop-in fee: $39.45
- Most common: $16.00 (Open Play), $20.00 (Expert Drop-In)

### The Conversion Opportunity

**Conservative Assumptions:**
- 20% conversion rate (industry benchmark)
- $99/month "Starter Membership" (lower barrier than current $120)
- 12-month average duration

**Revenue Model:**
- 1,849 pay-per-use players
- × 20% conversion rate
- = 369 new members
- × $99/month
- × 12 months
- = **$439,322/year**

### Strategic Approach: The "You're Already Paying" Conversion Campaign

**Email/SMS to pay-per-use players:**
> "Hi Mark Tomlinson,
>
> We noticed you've visited 8 times, spending $1081 in drop-in fees.
>
> Here's some math: You're on track to spend $12975/year on drop-ins.
>
> Our Starter Membership is $99/month ($1,188/year) with unlimited access.
>
> **You'd save $11787/year** and never worry about drop-in fees again.
>
> Ready to lock in your rate?"

**Why This Works:**
- Anchors to their CURRENT spend (loss aversion)
- Removes commitment anxiety (month-to-month option)
- Creates urgency (rates could increase)
- Leverages proven behavior (they already come regularly)

**This is the #9 JTBD: "Pay-Per-Use Fence-Sitter"** - They've crossed the beginner threshold, they're not public court players, they're regulars who just haven't committed yet.
