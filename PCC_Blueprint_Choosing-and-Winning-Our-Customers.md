### **The Clubhouse Blueprint: Choosing and Winning Our Customers**

How we will strategically identify, prioritize, and win our most valuable customer segments

This blueprint outlines our plan to build a powerful, resilient business model on a complete and validated market map. We will use the **JTBD framework** as our "ears" to listen for needs. We will use our **Total Market Map** to strategically choose our targets. And we will use **Segment-Specific Positioning** as our "voice" to win them.

This is how we become the clear, obvious choice for the most valuable members of our Pickleball Community. .

#### **Preamble: From Reactive Operations to Proactive Strategy**

Our year of operation have provided an invaluable stream of data, and we've successfully built a foundational business. But this data, by its nature, is *biased*. It only reflects the behaviors, needs, and "Jobs to be Done" of the customer segments who were already actively looking for a solution and were able to find us.

We are currently optimizing for a local market. To build a truly dominant, lucrative, and resilient business, we must move beyond reacting to our current members. We must proactively identify, understand, and map the *total addressable market*.

This document is our strategic plan to do just that. It's a blueprint for overcoming our current blindspots and making conscious, data-driven choices about which segments to target, how to win them, and—just as importantly—which to ignore. We will shift from being a facility reacting to its first customers to a market leader proactively choosing its future.

### **Part 1: The Foundation — Why We Must See Segments, Not Just Players**

Our strategy must be built on a deep, nuanced understanding of our customers. This understanding begins with rejecting a one-size-fits-all approach and recognizing that our market is composed of distinct groups with different motivations.

#### **What is a True Customer Segment?**

A true customer segment is not a demographic (e.g., "30-40-year-old men"). A true, actionable segment is a group of people who all share the same:

1. **Shared Job to be Done (The "Why"):** This is the underlying motivation, need, or progress they are trying to make. It’s the "job" they "hire" Pickleball Clubhouse Chicago to do (e.g., "Help me find a new social circle," "Help me get a competitive edge in my game").  
2. **Shared Value / Desired Outcomes (The "What"):** This is how they define success. It's their "hiring criteria"—the specific, measurable results they expect (e.g., "a fun, inviting lounge with events" vs. "access to 5.0 players and pro-led drills").  
3. **Shared Willingness to Pay (The "How Much"):** Because they share the same "why" and "what," they have a similar perception of value and a similar willingness to pay for that specific, desired outcome.

#### **Our Toolkit for Seeing Needs: The "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD) Framework**

To uncover these segments, we must become elite observers. The JTBD framework is our observational toolkit for listening to the *story* behind a member's actions. We are constantly listening for these signals:

* **The Struggling Moment:** The spark that causes a person to look for a new solution (e.g., "I was frustrated trying to find a decent public court," "I'm new to the city and don't know anyone").  
* **Forces of Progress (Pushes & Pulls):** The motivations driving them.  
  * **Pushes:** Problems with their current situation (e.g., "I feel isolated," "My current club is too crowded").  
  * **Pulls:** The appeal of our solution (e.g., "My friends are all here," "The pros and clean facilities look amazing").  
* **Frictions (Anxieties & Habits):** The forces holding them back.  
  * **Anxieties:** Fears about our solution (e.g., "Is it too expensive?" "Will I look stupid?").  
  * **Habits:** Allegiance to their old way (e.g., "I'm used to just playing for free at the park").  
* **Desired Outcomes:** Their specific definition of "value" and success (e.g., "I just want to be able to show up and have a well-matched game waiting for me").

When we see a *pattern* of people with the same Struggles, Forces, and Desired Outcomes, we have found a segment.

#### **Key Insight: One Member, Multiple Jobs**

A single person can have different "Jobs" depending on their context. This is the most critical insight for building a profitable, diverse product portfolio.

Consider a member named "Sarah." We cannot label her as just one "type" of customer.

* **Job 1 (Thursday Night): "Help me be a competitive player."**  
  * **Context:** She's preparing for a tournament.  
  * **Action:** She "hires" a Pro for a high-intensity, $120 lesson. She values the pro's skill and the private court. Her Willingness to Pay is high for this specific, outcome-focused product.  
  * **Segment:** "Competitive Improver"  
* **Job 2 (Saturday Morning): "Help me connect with my friends."**  
  * **Context:** She's meeting three friends for casual fun.  
  * **Action:** She "hires" a simple $60 "Pay-for-Use" court rental. She values court availability, a clean environment, and the lounge for a drink afterward.  
  * **Segment:** "Social Connector"

If we only saw Sarah as a "Competitive Improver," we would fail to create products for her "Social Connector" job. She "switches" between segments based on her context. This proves why we must have a diverse portfolio (lessons, memberships, pay-per-use, events, leagues) to capture *all* the value a single customer represents.

### **Part 2: The "Total Market View" — Our 5-Phase Plan to Find *All* Segments**

Our 10-month data bias is our biggest blindspot. This 5-phase plan is designed to surgically remove it and create a complete map of the market, allowing us to make conscious, strategic choices.

#### **Phase 1: Audit Our "Sliver" (Defining the Shadow Market)**

Before looking outside, we will use our 10 months of internal data to see who is conspicuously *missing*.

* **Action:** Analyze our booking data, membership types, and clinic attendance.  
* **Goal:** Create a "reverse persona." Who are we *not* seeing?  
* **Example:** Our data shows 80% of bookings are 5 PM-10 PM on weekdays and all weekend. The 9 AM-4 PM weekday slot is a ghost town. This "shadow market" (retirees, flexible WFH-ers, stay-at-home parents) is a massive, untapped asset whose "Job" we do not yet understand.

#### **Phase 2: Intercept the "Adjacent Market" (The Public Court Players)**

This is our single biggest opportunity: players who love the game but currently *don't pay* (or pay very little).

* **Action:** Conduct a primary research sprint. Go to the "watering holes": crowded public courts (Horner Park, Welles Park, etc.).  
* **Method:** Run 2-minute "intercept surveys." Offer a free-play pass in exchange for their time.  
* **Goal:** Uncover *their* "Job to be Done" by asking:  
  1. "What's the most *frustrating* part about playing here?" (Finds their **Struggling Moment**).  
  2. "What do you *love* most about playing here?" (Finds their **Desired Outcomes**).  
  3. "Have you ever considered a private club? Why or why not?" (Finds their **Anxieties** and **Habits**).  
* **Output:** We will discover new segments, like the **"Frustrated Competitor"** (who hates waiting and would pay for reliability) and the **"Casual Socialite"** (who values "free" and would be hard to convert).

#### **Phase 3: Deconstruct the "Captured Market" (Competitor & Social Intel)**

We will use our competitive and social intelligence plan not just to see *what* competitors are doing, but *who they are doing it for*.

* **Action:** Monitor competitor websites, social media (Instagram, TikTok, Reddit), and booking patterns (via Google Maps Popular Times API).  
* **Reframed Goal:** Ask, "**What *segment* is this event *built for*?**"  
* **Example:** A competitor's sold-out "Glow Pickleball" night is not just an "event"; it's proof they have successfully *captured* a **"Social Fun"** segment. Their "Morning Mixers & Mimosas" captures the **"Weekday Socialite"** from our "shadow market."

#### **Phase 4: Test the "Latent Market" (The Non-Players)**

This is our "blue ocean"—people who *could* play but don't. Their "Job" isn't "play pickleball"; it's "find a new hobby" or "do a fun team-building event."

* **Action:** Run small, low-cost "demand tests" targeted at proxy audiences.  
* **Method 1 (B2B):** Create a "Taste of Pickleball" corporate event package and pitch it to 10 local HR managers. This tests the **"Corporate Event Planner"** segment.  
* **Method 2 (B2C):** Run a $200 Facebook ad campaign for a "Total Beginner's Social Clinic." Target *interests* (e.g., "tennis," "Chicago social clubs," "fitness classes"), not "pickleball." This tests the **"'Pickle-Curious' Beginner"** segment.

#### **Phase 5: Synthesize & Prioritize (The Total Market Map)**

This is where it all comes together. We will combine all research (our "Sliver," the "Adjacent," "Captured," and "Latent" markets) into one complete map of *all* potential segments.

* **Action:** Plot all identified segments on a 2x2 matrix.  
  * **Y-Axis:** Segment Size / Value (Potential $$$)  
  * **X-Axis:** PCC's Right-to-Win (How well do our unique attributes solve their "Job"?)  
* **The Strategic Choice:** This map allows us to make conscious, executive-level decisions. We will sort all segments into three buckets: **Target, Watch, or Ignore.**

### **Part 3: The Action — Segment-Specific Positioning to Win**

Once our Total Market Map (Part 2\) has shown us *which* segments to target, we must win them. This is where we apply the principles from our "Positioning Workshop."

#### **Positioning is a Choice, Not a Description**

Positioning is not a description of what we are (a facility with courts). It is a *choice* to be seen as the *best and only solution* for a specific segment's "Job to be Done."

We will not have *one* positioning statement. We will have *multiple, distinct* positioning statements, one for each segment we choose to **Target**. The message for the "Social Connector" will be different from the message for the "Competitive Improver" because they value different things.

#### **Positioning in 3 Steps (To be completed for each Target Segment):**

1. **Define Their *Real* Alternative:** What would this segment do if we didn't exist? Our positioning must attack the *weakness* of this alternative.  
   * *Alternative for "Competitive Improver":* "Crowded, windy, unlit public courts."  
   * *Alternative for "Social Connector":* "A generic, loud bar," "a different hobby," or "staying home."  
2. **Map Our Unique Attributes to Their "Job":** This is the core of our value proposition. We must translate our *features* into *solutions* for *their* specific "Desired Outcomes."  
   * **Segment: "Competitive Improver"**  
     * *Our Attribute:* Top-tier Pros & Ball Machines  
     * *Their Desired Outcome:* Measurable game improvement  
     * *Our Positioning:* "We provide expert-led, focused training. Not just practice, but *progress*."  
   * **Segment: "Social Connector"**  
     * *Our Attribute:* Modern Bar, Lounge, & Social Leagues  
     * *Their Desired Outcome:* Effortless community connection  
     * *Our Positioning:* "We are a built-in community. Not just a court, but a *place* to belong."  
3. **Choose Our Market Category (per segment):** We must deliberately frame what "box" we fit into in the customer's mind. This sets their expectations and justifies our price.  
   * To the **"Competitive Improver,"** we are a **"Premium Training Facility."**  
   * To the **"Social Connector,"** we are a **"Next-Generation Social Club."**
