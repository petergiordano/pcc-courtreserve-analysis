## Project Overview

This analysis applies **Clayton Christensen's Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework** to segment customers at Pickleball Clubhouse Chicago based on behavioral data from CourtReserve.

**Analysis Date:** October 26, 2025
**Data Period:** October 1-26, 2025 (26 days)
**Customers Analyzed:** 670 active members

## Deliverables

### 1. Python Analysis Script
**File:** `analyze_courtreserve_jtbd.py`

Comprehensive analysis pipeline that:
- Loads and cleans 6 data sources (reservations, members, transactions, cancellations, events, check-ins)
- Engineers 31 behavioral features across temporal, social, engagement, and WTP dimensions
- Runs multiple clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Identifies context switchers (customers with different JTBDs in different contexts)
- Generates JTBD hypotheses using 9-element framework
- Outputs reports, JSON, and visualizations

**To run:**
```bash
python3 analyze_courtreserve_jtbd.py
```

**Dependencies:**
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### 2. Enhanced Analysis Report (Primary Deliverable)
**File:** `jtbd-analysis-report-enhanced.md`

**18-page comprehensive report** containing:

#### Key Findings
- **5 distinct behavioral segments** discovered
- **79 context switchers** identified (11.8% of customers)
- **$376,488/year revenue opportunity** from addressing programming gaps

#### Segment Profiles

| Segment | Size | Key Characteristics | Primary JTBD |
|---------|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Weekday Evening Enthusiasts** | 214 (32%) | 98% weekday, 54% evening, 27.8 bookings/month | Unwind after work with flexible exercise |
| **Premium Members** | 178 (27%) | Tier 3.5/5, 13.4 bookings/month, balanced timing | Convenient fitness for busy professionals |
| **Ultra-Engaged Weekday Players** | 36 (5%) | 24.8 bookings/month, highest partner variety | Maximize play volume and improvement |
| **Weekend Warriors** | 158 (24%) | Lowest frequency (7.3), lowest partner variety | Social recreation with friends |
| **Weekend Morning Regulars** | 84 (13%) | 97% weekend, 65% morning, 29.1 bookings/month | Energizing social exercise before weekend commitments |

#### Programming Gap Analysis
1. **Zero event participation** across all segments → $32,160/year opportunity
2. **Weekday evening matchmaking** needed → $108,000/year opportunity
3. **Premium member underutilization** → $54,000/year retention at risk
4. **Weekend programming void** → $28,728/year opportunity
5. **Family programming missing** → $141,000/year opportunity

#### Context Switching Examples
- Percy Wang (#6457691): Different JTBDs in morning vs. evening, weekday vs. weekend
- Validates context-based segmentation approach

#### Next Steps
- Immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term recommendations
- Data quality improvement priorities
- CIC dashboard integration roadmap

### 3. Machine-Readable Results
**File:** `analysis-results.json`

Structured JSON export containing:
- Summary statistics
- Segment profiles with JTBD statements
- Behavioral signals (temporal, social, engagement)
- Context switcher examples
- Methodology metadata

**Purpose:** Integration into Customer Intelligence Center (CIC) dashboard

**Example usage:**
```javascript
import analysisResults from './analysis-results.json';

// Get segment by ID
const segment = analysisResults.segments.find(s => s.id === 0);
console.log(segment.name); // "Weekday Evening Enthusiasts"

// Get behavioral signals
console.log(segment.behavioral_signals.temporal.pct_evening); // 0.54

// Get JTBD statement
console.log(segment.jtbd_statement.context);
// "when finishing a busy workday and looking to decompress..."
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Context > Demographics
**The same person represents different segments in different contexts.**

Traditional segmentation: "Aaron is a Fight Club member, age 35, plays 12x/month"
→ One-size-fits-all marketing

JTBD segmentation: "Aaron is a Consistent Exerciser on Tuesday mornings, but a Social Connector on Friday evenings"
→ Context-specific programming and messaging

### 2. High Engagement ≠ High WTP
**Segment 2 (Ultra-Engaged Weekday Players) has:**
- Highest frequency: 24.8 bookings/month
- Lowest membership tier: 1.4/5

**Implication:** Price-sensitive enthusiasts need tier optimization messaging.

### 3. Premium Members Are Underutilized
**Segment 1 (Premium Members) has:**
- Highest membership tier: 3.5/5
- Moderate frequency: 13.4 bookings/month
- Zero event participation

**Implication:** Churn risk if they don't feel they're getting value. Need activation campaigns.

### 4. Zero Event Participation Across All Segments
**Possible causes:**
- Data quality issue (event registrations in separate system)
- Event awareness problem
- Event programming mismatch with customer needs

**Action:** Investigate immediately. Huge opportunity or red flag.

### 5. Weekend Programming Gap
**84 customers (13%) play almost exclusively weekend mornings with highest engagement (29.1 bookings/month).**

Yet zero event participation suggests no compelling weekend programming exists.

**Opportunity:** "Weekend Morning Social Club" could generate $28,728/year.

3. Object of the Verb - What are they acting upon?
4. Contextual Clarifier - In what situation/context?
5. Desired Outcome - What end result do they want?
6. Metric - How do they measure success?
7. Constraints - What limitations exist?
8. Emotional/Social Dimensions - How do they want to feel?
9. Time Dimension - When/how often does this job arise?

## Data Quality Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues

1. **Sparse Transaction Data**
   - Only 366 records for 4,477 members
   - Many bookings show $0 spend
   - Cannot validate WTP or measure ancillary revenue
   - **Action:** Investigate transaction export settings

2. **Zero Event Participation**
   - ALL segments show 0% event participation
   - Inconsistent with Event_Summary.csv showing 1,971 event sessions
   - **Action:** Reconcile reservation vs. event registration systems

### Limitations

3. **Partial Month (Oct 1-26)**
   - Monthly metrics extrapolated from 26 days
   - Seasonal bias possible

4. **New Facility (Opened Feb 2025)**
   - Only 8 months history
   - Churn patterns not established

5. **Self-Selection Bias**
   - Only current members analyzed
   - Churned members and lost leads not represented

## Next Analysis: Phase 2 Priorities

### 1. Validate JTBD Hypotheses (Qualitative Research)
**Method:** Interview 2-3 customers from each segment
**Questions:**
- "What job are you hiring pickleball to do for you?"
- "How do you measure a successful pickleball session?"
- "What would make you play more often?"

### 2. Churn Analysis
**Objective:** Identify early warning signs by segment
**Data needed:** Churned member dataset with exit dates/reasons
**Output:** Churn prediction model, retention playbooks

### 3. LTV Modeling
**Objective:** Calculate customer lifetime value by segment and context
**Data needed:** Complete transaction history (need to fix data gap!)
**Output:** Segment prioritization matrix, pricing optimization

### 4. Competitive Benchmarking
**Objective:** Compare PCC programming vs. competitor offerings by segment
**Data needed:** Competitor facility audits, pricing research
**Output:** White-space opportunity map, positioning strategies

### 5. Demand Forecasting
**Objective:** Predict court utilization by segment, day, time
**Data needed:** 6-12 months historical booking data
**Output:** Dynamic pricing model, capacity planning
