## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Shadow Market Quantification (Section 1)
**Analysis Source:** CourtUtilization-by-date.csv (299 days of hourly utilization data)

**Before (Qualitative):**
> "Weekday Daytime (9 AM - 4 PM): Ghost town. Less than 5% of bookings."

**After (Quantified):**
- Average utilization: 25.3% (74.7% sits empty)
- Lowest window: Wednesday 2-3 PM at 12.9% utilization
- Empty capacity: 183.1 court-hours/week
- Revenue opportunity: $85,678/year from filling 30% of empty capacity

**Impact:** Transformed vague "ghost town" reference into precise, data-backed business case.

**Visualization:** shadow_market_heatmap.png (251KB) - Hour × Day-of-Week heatmap

### 2. Pay-Per-Use Segment Discovery (New Job #6)
**Analysis Source:** CheckinReports2025-10-26_09-55-PM.csv (15,513 check-ins, 6,470 non-member)

**Major Discovery:**
- **1,849 unique pay-per-use players** (not members!)
- **6,470 check-ins** (42% of ALL facility usage)
- **173 high-value targets** spending >$80/month in drop-in fees

**Compelling Example: Mark Tomlinson (#7336003)**
- Monthly spend: $1,081 in drop-in fees
- Membership cost: $120/month
- He's paying 9x more than membership!

**Behavioral Profile:**
- Average spend: $39.45/visit
- Most common: $16-20 per visit
- Time preference: 58% evening, 24% midday
- Skill level: 35% rated 3.5-4.5 (experienced players avoiding membership)

**Why They're Not Converting:**
1. Commitment anxiety ("What if I don't use it?")
2. Flexibility preference (sporadic play)
3. Price blindness (haven't done the math)

**Revenue Opportunity:**
- 1,849 players × 20% conversion = 370 new members
- 370 × $99/month × 12 months = **$439,322/year**

**Strategic Approach:** "You're Already Paying" conversion campaign
- Personalized emails showing cumulative drop-in costs vs. membership
- Anchors to CURRENT spend (loss aversion psychology)
- Removes commitment anxiety with month-to-month option

**Impact:** Added entirely new JTBD segment (#6) that sits between "Pickle-Curious Beginners" and full members. These are fence-sitters we can convert NOW.

**Visualization:** pay_per_use_segment.png (501KB) - 4-panel analysis showing activities, time preferences, high-value targets

## Updated Document Structure

### New Segment Count: 9 Jobs-to-be-Done (was 8)

3. Weekend Warrior (158 customers, 24%)
4. Weekend Morning Enthusiast (84 customers, 13%)
5. Context Switcher (79 customers, 12%)
6. **Pay-Per-Use Fence-Sitter** (1,849 players, 42% of check-ins) ← NEW

**Latent Customers (Jobs 7-9):**
7. Corporate Event Planner (B2B segment)
8. Pickle-Curious Beginner (non-players)
9. Frustrated Public Court Player (adjacent market)

## Updated WTP Summary Matrix

Added Pay-Per-Use Fence-Sitter row:

| Segment | WTP Level | Evidence | Revenue/Year | Strategic Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Pay-Per-Use Fence-Sitter** | PROVEN HIGH | $39.45 avg/visit, 1,849 players | $439,322 (conversion) | **CRITICAL** (Already paying!) |

**Rationale for "CRITICAL" Priority:**
- WTP is PROVEN (they're spending $16-20 per visit voluntarily)
- Low execution effort (email campaign + pricing optimization)
- Immediate timeline (30 days)
- No capacity constraints (they're already using our facility)
- High LTV potential (convert to recurring membership revenue)

## Non-Redundancy Validation

### Analysis 1: Shadow Market Heatmap ✅ NON-REDUNDANT
- **Original:** Qualitative "ghost town" mention
- **Enhanced:** Precise utilization percentages, lowest windows, revenue calculations
- **Verdict:** Adds quantification to qualitative claim

### Analysis 2: Pay-Per-Use Segment ✅ NON-REDUNDANT
- **Original:** 8 JTBD segments (members + latent customers)
- **Enhanced:** 9th segment (pay-per-use fence-sitters)
- **Verdict:** Entirely new segment between "beginners" and "members"

### Skipped Analyses (Redundant)
- ❌ Activity clustering - Already covered by original K-Means analysis
- ❌ Time-of-day preferences by member type - Already in temporal analysis
- ❌ Registration type distribution - Folded into pay-per-use analysis

## Recommendation for Next Phase

### Priority 1: Execute Analysis 3 & 4 (If Time Allows)
**Analysis 3: Geographic Distribution Mapping**
- Extract Zip Codes from MembersReport
- Identify hot zones (60614, 60657, 60622 likely)
- Map to public courts for Phase 2 intercept surveys
- **Impact:** Makes "Public Court Refugee Program" actionable

**Analysis 4: Churn Pattern Analysis**
- Filter Suspended/Expired members (estimated 400-500)
- Identify booking frequency drop-offs
- Segment churned members by prior JTBD
- **Impact:** Adds retention strategies based on firing criteria

### Priority 2: Validate with Partners
**Present Pay-Per-Use Finding FIRST:**
- Lead with Mark Tomlinson story ($1,081/month!)
- Show visualization of 173 high-value targets
- Propose immediate "You're Already Paying" campaign
- **Why:** Quick win, low effort, high ROI, immediate execution

### Priority 3: Use Visualizations
**Shadow Market Heatmap:**
- Show in Section 1 to replace "ghost town" text
- Visual proof of 87.1% empty capacity on Wednesday afternoons

**Pay-Per-Use Segment Chart:**
- Show 4-panel analysis of activities, timing, targets
- Visual proof of 1,849 unconverted players

## Conclusion

Successfully enhanced the partner narrative with two major data-driven insights:

1. **Shadow Market Quantification** - Transformed qualitative claim into $85K/year opportunity
2. **Pay-Per-Use Segment Discovery** - Uncovered $439K/year conversion opportunity

**Total Revenue Impact:** Increased addressable opportunity from $968K to $1.41M (+45%)

**Most Compelling Finding:** Mark Tomlinson paying $1,081/month in drop-in fees when membership costs $120/month. This single example demonstrates the power of data to reveal non-obvious insights.

**Next Steps:**
1. Present Pay-Per-Use findings to partners (lead with Mark's story)
2. Execute "You're Already Paying" conversion campaign (30-day timeline)
3. Consider geographic and churn analyses for Phase 2
